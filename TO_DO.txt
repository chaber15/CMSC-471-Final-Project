- Update model so that tree actually reflects real model (precompute results and highlightPathToLeaf function)
- Tree should only begin to grow if train is clicked (when page is loaded) -> ONLY IF WE HAVE TIME
- Display model accuracy 
- Show explanation above legend? 
- Explanation (multiply buttons 3-4 what is random forest, how model is built, how training works, how num of tree's, depth improves accuracy) 
	- what does random forest mean (how model uses a subset of data for each tree)
	- how are trees trained, talk about entropy 
	- talk about how each tree makes predictions and how the whole model makes predictions 
 	- Talk about how number of tree's and depth predicts accuracy 
- Display what the tree predicted v what the model did
